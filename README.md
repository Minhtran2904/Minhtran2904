Hello there,

Welcome to my very own Github. I am, at the moment of this README.md is written, a full-time student at 42-Hive, Helsinki, Finland. 
I have no experience in coding prior to the year 2022, and thus, this is an extremely special challenge for me. I manage to press on, and thus given the chance to study more!
In this hub of mine, lies different projects from Hive that I am/was attending. 

I expect that, should I find different projects interesting and worth spending time pulling my hair off doing, I would!

Enjoy your stay!
