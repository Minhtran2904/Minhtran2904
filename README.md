My **background** is in Financial Analytics and Consultant. My **passion** is with programming. 
<p></p>
Do I have to choose only one? Not necessarily! I aspire to be a data analysis, utilizing technical tools that I gained from previous working experience, hobbies, and curiosity.

My technical arsenal includes, and continues to expand from:
- _Programming language_: Python, C, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, R (basic)
- _Framework_: React
- _Data Analytics_: Pandas for Python
- _Visualization_: Power BI, Qlik Sense
- _Relational Database Management_: SQL, dbSchemas
- _Team-Scrum_: Scrum Methodology
- _Finance_: Due Diligence, Financial analysis, Data Analysis.

Seeking chance to be invested in, be encouraged and guided to the right path of development.

Enjoy your stay!
